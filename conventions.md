A list of conventions I think we should adhere to for development:

1. No committing to main, only dedicated branches and pull requests
2. Get approval for your pull requests before merging
3. Single-purpose commits
4. Commit messages on everything
5. Automated testing on merge once we get set up - anyone know how to do this? I suspect something to do with pipelines (only ever used gitlab before)
